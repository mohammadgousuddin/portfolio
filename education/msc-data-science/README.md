Place any related files for the M.Sc (Data Science) entry here (transcripts, certificate images, PDFs). Name the primary certificate file `certificate.pdf` so the detail page's 'View Certificate' link can point to it directly.

Examples:
- certificate.pdf
- transcript.pdf
- thumbnail.jpg

Note: Update `index.html` fields with exact institution, completion year, and highlight items as desired.

Placeholder: A small placeholder `certificate.pdf` has been added to this folder. Replace it with the official certificate file when ready.
